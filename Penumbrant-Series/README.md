# Penumbrant Series

## Overview
The Penumbrant Series (PS) contains factsheets that provide an overview of the gray area surrounding cannabis laws in various states. These papers are written to introduce readers to the ambiguity of cannabis law and its complex origins, particularly regarding the incongruence between states' rights and the Federal government's continued hard-line stance of maintaining marijuana under its Schedule 1 restricted status.

## Purpose
PS Papers aim to:
- Highlight the legal gray areas in state cannabis regulations
- Explain the tension between state and federal cannabis laws
- Provide context on the historical and political origins of cannabis law ambiguity
- Serve as an introduction to the complexities of cannabis legislation

## File Organization
Each state's Penumbrant Series documents should be organized by state abbreviation:
- `[STATE-ABBREV]-penumbrant-series.pdf` (Full papers, 50+ pages)
- `[STATE-ABBREV]-penumbrant-one-pager.pdf` (Summary versions)

Example:
- `CO-penumbrant-series.pdf`
- `CO-penumbrant-one-pager.pdf`

## Maintenance Schedule
**Bi-Weekly Updates:**
- Review and update existing state papers for legal changes
- Add new state papers as research is completed
- Update references and citations
- Review federal policy changes that may impact state-level analysis
