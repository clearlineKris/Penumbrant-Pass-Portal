# ORA Reports

## Overview
ORA Reports detail the basic intricacies of the dichotomy between Operators (Ops) and the Regulators (Regs) in place. These reports analyze the relationship, tensions, and interactions between cannabis business operators and the regulatory bodies that oversee them.

## Purpose
ORA Reports aim to:
- Explain the roles and responsibilities of Operators vs Regulators
- Analyze the power dynamics and tensions in cannabis regulation
- Provide insights into compliance requirements and regulatory frameworks
- Document the practical challenges of operating within regulated cannabis markets

## File Organization
Each state's ORA Reports should be organized by state abbreviation:
- `[STATE-ABBREV]-ora-report.pdf` (Full reports, detailed analysis)
- `[STATE-ABBREV]-ora-leaflet.pdf` (Summary versions)

Example:
- `CO-ora-report.pdf`
- `CO-ora-leaflet.pdf`

## Maintenance Schedule
**Bi-Weekly Updates:**
- Review and update existing state reports for regulatory changes
- Add new state reports as research is completed
- Update operator requirements and regulatory body information
- Track changes in enforcement practices and compliance standards

## Contributing
When adding or updating ORA Reports:
1. Include state abbreviation in filename
2. Date the document version
3. Include all relevant regulatory citations and sources
4. Document both operator and regulator perspectives
5. Update the main README.md with links to new reports

## Notes
- Full ORA Reports are excluded from Git tracking via .gitignore
- ORA Leaflets (summaries) may be included in the repository for quick reference
- All content should provide analysis and context, NOT legal advice
- Focus on the practical aspects of the Operator-Regulator relationship
